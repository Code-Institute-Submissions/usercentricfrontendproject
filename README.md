# User Centric Front End Development Milestone Project #

This project is designed as a marketing tool for our own farm.  This website will allow us to showcase what we have on offer and be a 
method for prospective buyers to contact us.  The aim is to highlight the selling features of our products, both livestock and flowers.  

## UX ##
This site was designed for users looking for additional information on our products to be able to find it easily.  It is also a way for
potential customers to discover what we have to offer. The information is laid out simply and is thorough with multiple ways for someone
to contact us to find out more.  The site is desinged to provide a comprehensive overview.

## Wireframes ##
The mockups for the project are available at usercentricfrontendproject/assets/mockups/Milestone%20Project%201%20Mockup.pdf

## Features ##
**Existing Features**
        Feature 1 - Users can directly contact us through the Contact page in an easy to use manner.
        Feature 2 - Users can connect with our social networks through the links in the footer.
        Feature 3 - Users can get a visual representation of what we have on offer through the For Sale and Gallery pages.  

**Features to Implement**
    A few features that would need to be added in the future.  
        The contact form needs to be functional. 
        The for sale page will need to list individual animals that we are selling with photos, stats etc.
        Videos would be added as part of the gallery. 
        A blog or news feature will also be added to provide information and updates on the site.

## Testing ##
The site site was tested continually during development.  As I was creating the site, I continually tested elements through Google Chrome inspect
at various screen sizes.  Designing the site with a mobile-first approach led to minor issues in the beginning but all have been resolved.

The Navbar was an ongoing issue throughout the development.  The idea was to include a Bootstrap toggler menu on mobile.  After various attempts and
thorough testing, I was unable to successfully implement the feature.  The menu on mobile is easy to use and looks well but ideally the site
would have the toggler menu.  This is also why so many versions have changes to the Navbar.

The contact form is not fully functional as it does not link up to any back end database.  


## Deployment ##
The site was deployed as directed in the project guidelines.
