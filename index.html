                <p>Ashlawn Farm is an eighth generation family farm located in the heart of Ireland’s midlands, County Westmeath.   The farm has been in liquid milk since Kenneth’s grandfather was running the place and is a supplier to Glanbia.</p>
&NonBreakingSpace;
<p>The farm has a split calving season and has been a closed herd for over 30 years rearing all its own replacement heifers and relying on AI technology for breeding.  The majority of the herd are registered black and white Holstein with a few red and whites, Friesians and Jersey-cross cows included.  The herd is classified twice a year and milk recording is done nearly every month year round.</p>  
&nbsp;
<p>There is also an Angus-cross herd of beef cattle on the farm.  These cows have been bred from the dairy side as the herd is considered closed.  The Holstein x Angus cows are bred back to Angus and sold as weanlings.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Due to the climate in central Ireland, the cows graze grass for 300 days a year and otherwise are fed a grass silage produced on the farm during the summer.  The cows are supplemented with a grain pellet for the winter months.   </p>
&nbsp;
<p>In 2018, the cut flower section was added.  This was a was to enhance land that was not fully utilized for grass by growing cut flowers and selling direct to consumers.  Ashlawn Farm Flowers can be bought at various Farmers Markets in the Midlands. </p>
